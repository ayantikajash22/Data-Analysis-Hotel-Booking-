## Business Problem

City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been experiencing high cancellation
rates in recent years. This has resulted in lower revenues and
inefficient room utilization. Reducing cancellations has therefore
become a key objective to improve revenue generation and operational
efficiency.\
This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations, identifies the key
factors behind them, and provides actionable recommendations for the
hotels.

## Assumptions

1.  No extraordinary events occurred between 2015 and 2017 that would
    significantly affect the dataset.\
2.  The dataset remains relevant for building effective hotel
    strategies.\
3.  No unforeseen risks are associated with implementing the
    recommendations.\
4.  The hotels have not yet adopted the suggested solutions.\
5.  Booking cancellations are the main factor impacting revenue
    generation.\
6.  Cancelled bookings leave rooms unoccupied for the reserved
    duration.\
7.  Customers cancel their bookings within the same year the reservation
    is made.

## Research Questions

1.  Which factors influence hotel booking cancellations?\
2.  What strategies can be adopted to reduce cancellations?\
3.  How can this analysis support hotels in making better pricing and
    promotional decisions?

## Hypotheses

1.  Higher room prices are associated with higher cancellation rates.\
2.  Longer waiting lists are linked to an increase in cancellations.\
3.  A significant proportion of customers book their stays through
    offline travel agents.

## Tools & Technologies

-   **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)\
-   **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization\
-   **ReportLab / Markdown** for reporting\
-   **SQL** (optional) for advanced querying

## Project Workflow

1.  **Data Collection** -- Import data from CSV/Excel or databases.\
2.  **Data Cleaning** -- Handle missing values, duplicates, data types,
    and outliers.\
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** -- Explore data distributions,
    visualize trends, and identify correlations.\
4.  **Feature Engineering** -- Create relevant variables (e.g., lead
    time, customer type).\
5.  **Modeling & Hypothesis Testing** -- Validate assumptions using
    statistical tests and machine learning.\
6.  **Insights & Recommendations** -- Summarize findings and propose
    actionable strategies.

## Expected Outcomes

-   Identification of the most influential variables affecting
    cancellations.\
-   Data-driven strategies to reduce cancellation rates.\
-   Guidance for hotels in pricing, promotion, and operational
    decision-making.
