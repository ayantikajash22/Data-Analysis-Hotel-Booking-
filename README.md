# Hotel Booking Cancellations Analysis

## Business Problem

City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates in
recent years. This issue has caused revenue losses and inefficient room
utilization. Reducing cancellations is now the primary goal for both
hotels to improve efficiency and revenue generation.\
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations and other
related factors to provide strategic recommendations.

## Assumptions

1.  No unusual occurrences between 2015--2017 significantly affected the
    dataset.\
2.  The dataset is still valid for analyzing hotel strategies.\
3.  There are no unforeseen disadvantages in implementing the
    recommendations.\
4.  The hotels have not yet applied the proposed solutions.\
5.  Booking cancellations are the main factor limiting revenue
    generation.\
6.  Cancelled bookings result in vacant rooms for the reserved
    duration.\
7.  Customers cancel their bookings within the same year they make them.

## Research Questions

1.  What factors influence hotel booking cancellations?\
2.  How can hotels reduce booking cancellations?\
3.  How can this analysis support pricing and promotional
    decision-making?

## Hypotheses

1.  Higher prices result in more cancellations.\
2.  Longer waiting lists increase the likelihood of cancellations.\
3.  Most clients book through offline travel agents.

## Analysis & Findings

-   Around **37% of clients cancel their reservations**, significantly
    impacting revenue.\
-   **City Hotels** receive more bookings than Resort Hotels, likely due
    to pricing differences.\
-   **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** Resort hotels charge higher rates on
    weekends and holidays.\
-   **Seasonality:** August has the highest number of reservations and
    cancellations; January has the highest cancellation rate.\
-   **Price sensitivity:** Cancellations rise when prices increase.\
-   **Country analysis:** Portugal records the highest number of
    cancellations.\
-   **Booking channels:** 46% of clients use online travel agencies, 27%
    through groups, while only 4% book directly.

## Suggestions

1.  Adjust pricing strategies---offer discounts or location-based
    pricing to reduce cancellations.\
2.  Provide special offers on weekends/holidays, especially for Resort
    Hotels.\
3.  Run marketing campaigns in **January** to offset high
    cancellations.\
4.  Improve service quality and offerings in **Portugal**, where
    cancellations are highest.
